## Intro

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Hindi language(Yes, it is not a programming language), and I am also a developer. I love the idea of open-source and I extensively participate in many open-source projects. My blog primarily shares my ideas on technology, programming and life. Welcome to see more about me at [https://holger.one/about/](https://holger.one/about/)
