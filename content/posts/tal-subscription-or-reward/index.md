## INTRODUCTION 

In order to keep customers stick to your product, you’ll have to _give benefits_ to your existing customers. There are two popular ways to do this, one is _reward schemes_ and the other is _subscription services_. 

### Background Information 

Parents in _China_ nowadays spend an _enormous_ amount of money on their children, and one _crucial_ part is education, which is often referred to as _Extra-Curriculum Courses_. The money mostly ends up at **TAL,** as it’s probably one of the most _experienced and capable_ education institutions. However, as more and more other cheaper institutions come out, TAL is losing its _competitiveness_ on customer retention. **TAL** is now considering two strategies to tackle this dilemma, one, which has already been used right now, is to _give rewards_ to its students, and the other is to take out _subscription services_. 

This essay will describe the _advantages_ and _disadvantages_ of both strategies.

## Body 

### Reward schemes 

This _scheme_, which has been carried out for a long time, is to give students small prizes like some notebooks or schoolbags. Instead of giving rewards directly to customers, students gain _points_ during classes and _redeem their rewards_ afterward. This approach makes it _easier_ for running this system and can _stimulate_ the interests of learning. Furthermore, pushed by this sort of reward, students will _concentrate on_ their studies without getting distracted so that they can learn _more_ knowledge.

However, this method is _truly_ effective in lower grades while it becomes less useful for higher grades. Unlike young teenagers who need rewards to _focus on_ their studies, older students have _no_ interest in getting so little gifts. They simply want to learn quietly and alone _without_ interacting with teachers. Therefore, this approach becomes _incapable_ of older students and they may easily _turn to_ other educational institutions. 

In this way, despite it is partly effective, **TAL** needs other ways to retain its customers.

### Subscription services 

This way requires customers to _pay_ for a little money and _TAL_ would provide more _sophisticated_ services such as _free consulting_. Customers will be _more likely_ to stay in the _same_ company if they pay for _long-term_ services. _TAL_ can also get more information from their customers in order to provide better services, which will result in a _Win-Win_ solution. This method may _strengthen_ the connections between _teachers_ and _students_. Students won’t leave if they trust their teacher.

On the other hand, parents might be unwilling to pay extra money when they have already paid for the courses. Yet, this service can improve the learning achievements, parents are very difficult to give in. 

## Conclusion 

It seems that both methods have their own benefits and drawbacks, so it’s better to combine different ways into a complete customer retention system. In the future, TAL may consider using both ways to regain its losing customers.
